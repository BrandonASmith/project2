# project2

- This app will allow users and their family/friends to privately share recipes in the circle.

- Users will be able to login, post/edit their own recipes, review other recipes, and share their favorites throughout the group(s).

- The goal is to make recipes viewable only by selected recipients given access. But sharing is caring...

- This will be a place where you can spread the love and share your 'secret' recipe with the world, 
  or preserve the tradition and keep it in fam.

- We're all family. Lets break bread, together.
